    <h1 id="content">Original Idea</h1>
    <p>As a fan of Synthwave music and art, I wanted to make a website dedicated for it just for the fun of it.
        Later on I decided to turn it into a sort of blog.
    </p>   

<h1>Original Design</h1>

    <p>Originally, I had a section dedicated for Synthwave artists such as Kavinsky and The Midnight, describing 
        them in a dynamically generated page. Along with a section dedicated for music mixes. But since embedding too many 
        youtube videos would cause the page to lag, I decided to just create a Mix model and have a youtube link field and then 
        just show an image of the actual thumbnail.
    </p> 
    <h1>Why Music?</h1>  
    <p>I don't know, I was just listening to Synthwave and just felt that the music along with the design 
        makes me feel some type of way and just wanted to find a method to share this in the hopes that it might make 
        other people feel the same way. 
        Originally it was just one song which is the "Sunset beach" from the Synthwave mix but then expanded it to make it 
        a type of basic Music player. This was accomplished using Django models and Javascript.  
    </p>
<h1>Difficulties</h1>
    <p>
        I did not really have any difficulties making this one. It's relatively simple compared to the E-commerce 
        website since there are not many functions. Blogs might be the easiest thing to do since it's just information.
        You make a site and then you fill it with content. Now granted there are more features and things to worry about such 
        as SEO optimization and perhaps introducing the ability to comment and maybe link a social media account? 
        But yea since this is not really a commercial project but more like a hub for docs with a basic music player. There's no need to implement more features. 
    </p>


    <h1 id="conculsion">
        Conclusion
    </h1>

      <p>It's a short doc, but again this project is not really that complicated. Hope you had a good time reading!</p>
