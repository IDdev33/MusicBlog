    <p>At first I remember all the doomers, clickbaiting people on YouTube and other social media 
        and claiming that A.I is gonna replace programmers. For a minute, I too believed it but after experimenting 
        with ChatGPT, I quickly realized it's still very limited and we probably have like 4 or 5 years 
        until the A.I overlords replace everybody.
    </p> 
    <p>Hell it's not just programmers. Artists, Lawyers, Health experts, even Music artists are in danger 
        if it keeps advancing. You can literally tell ChatGPT to write you a Drake verse and it'd do it in like 
    5 seconds. So now Ghost writers are going bankrupt too. But on a serious note it's a very useful tool. Let 
me tell you my experience with it.  </p>  
<h1>Helps with Debbuging Code</h1>
<p>One of its most useful features in my opinion. If you write a block of code and you forgot a comma or a quote perhaps,
    instead of staring at the code for 5 hours, what you can do is simply copy your code and paste it in ChatGPT's prompt
and it'd tell you where the mistake is. This saved me so much time honestly.</p>
<h1>It can produce buggy code</h1>
<p>You have to be careful with this. If you blindly copy paste code from it, unless your project was 
    to get the sum of 1+1, then chances are it'll mess up your entire project. In my experience there were several 
    times when it made a reference to an element that did not exist, wrote code in a very complicated way when there was 
    a more simple way and even just created more bugs.
</p>
<h1>Struggles with Creativity</h1>
<p>This is one of the reasons why it has not replaced programmers yet. It does not have creativity and cannot 
    think like we do because obviously it's a language model. Like there was a time when I was struggling 
with the receipt function in the Alienware website. But then I had an epiphany to simply create a model 
and just save the info in the database. No amount of carefully structured queries made ChatGPT suggest this 
to me.</p>
<h1>Explains stuff really good</h1>
<p>Again one of its strongest points. If you wanted to understand how API calls in Javascript work and what each 
    of the syntax means, then it's the right bot for you. Instead of watching a YouTube video, you can easily get info from it.
    And also being trained on such a massive amount of data, if you have an idea for a feature but don't know if it's 
    even possible in the first place, it can help you with that and will actually lay out all the steps to achieve it.
</p>
<h1>MidJourney is something else</h1>
<p>It's basically Dalle on steroids. Super awesome for generating creative images. I have not actually used it yet 
    because I know you have to join their discord which I simply refuse to use, due to all the memes about their mods,
    but I have seen the work it can do and it's absolutely astonishing. Animators use it to make incredible 
    art. 
</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Overall, A.I tools are super helpful but just like anything out there, you have to be careful with it. </p>
